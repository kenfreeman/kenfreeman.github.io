Carole and David
 
Feel free to post the Naturalization Paper.  My dad told me today about
having been in touch with you several years ago.  The funny thing is that he
never mentioned it when we were digging through my parents' boxes of photos
and records for my son's 4th grade immigration and family history project
last year.  The Naturalization Paper is framed and hanging in my parents'
house, and we had them scanned to use on my son's poster for his project.
That's why I had a pdf file handy to send you.  The good thing is that my
daughter will have to do the same project for school next year, and now we
have a lot more information on the Walzers.

Hi cousin Suzanne:
 
Thank you for the pictures and the Naturalization Papers.  When we find one
of my grandmother I will send it to you.
 
We are in the process of finding the Naturalization Papers for the family
members. I have one of my grandmother Irene's.   Once we scan it into the
computer we will send you a copy.
 
If it is ok with you, we would like to post Naturalization Paper on our
website.
 
Looking forward to keeping in contact with you.
 
Thank you.

Carole and David Annenberg

Subject: Walzer family document and photos

David and Carole,
 
I have attached a copy of Max Walzer's naturalization papers from 1906.  He
is identified as Sapsy Max Walzer.  When I knew him, people called him Max,
but I was told that his real name was Samuel.   I remember him telling me
and my brothers that his Hebrew name was Schepsel.
 
The photos attached are of Max and Rose and their children Sylvia, Dorothy,
and Joseph, my father.  Sylvia and Dorothy were actually the daughters of
Max's first wife, but that was not discussed when my father was a child.  My
father has always said that he was 4 years old in the picture.  My uncle
Seymour had not yet been born.
 
Susanne Robinson
