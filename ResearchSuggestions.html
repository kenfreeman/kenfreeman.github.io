<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Our Research Suggestion Page</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">We have used various way's to document the information we 
receive about our families. This Page is meant to show how we Document the 
Information on our site and in our files.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We interview family members, use Census Records for both 
the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. While most of our family 
currently resides in the United States, we have used Canadian and United Kingdom 
Census for our ancestor's.&nbsp;We have Birth, Marriage, Social Security and Death 
Certificates, Birth, Engagement and Marriage Announcements as well as 
Obituaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have used Passenger Records from Ellis Island and Castle 
Garden, New York as well as&nbsp; other ports of arrival in the United States. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Cemetery hopping and family notes are also a big help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In addition , we have used the&nbsp; 2 books listed below for 
family information.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">‘There once was a World a 
900 Year Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok’&nbsp;&nbsp; By Yaffa Elach</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">'Tradition and Modernism in the Shtetl 
Aisheshuk, 1919 – 1930'&nbsp; by Ellen Livingston. (Ellen is part of the Shlanski 
Family, thought to be related to David through the Berkowitz or Yanklevich 
families).</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Link's to some of our documentation are 
listed at the bottom of this page.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The 1st step was to input into our Family Tree File the 
information we knew. Where we could not&nbsp; make the connection, we went to the 
next step.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The 2nd&nbsp; step was family interviews. We both interviewed 
various family members. The interview process was in 2 parts.&nbsp; The first part 
was in person. We asked Family members about there recollection about who was 
who.&nbsp; The Second part was having our out of town Family members do the same 
thing.&nbsp;They did this by sending us their information.&nbsp; Various other Family&nbsp; 
Members also sent us either their branch or the research they had done.&nbsp; We have 
received most of our information from Family Members who had done the research 
and they&nbsp; sent&nbsp; us what they had. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our 3rd and 4th steps were Cemetery hoping and NYC 
Municipal Archives/NYC Board of Health Research. Most of the family we are 
looking for settled in New York City upon arrival from the home countries.&nbsp; We 
knew where some of our family was buried based upon either our Being at the 
Funeral or Family Notes.&nbsp; We would then order the Death Certificates based upon 
Tombstone and Cemetery Information.&nbsp; In addition to NYC Death Certificates, we 
received some from California and Florida.&nbsp; We also used Birth Certificates and 
Marriage Certificates&nbsp; from the Municipal Archives.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can&nbsp; use the Italian Genealogy Group, the German 
Genealogy Group and Steve Morse's website for New York City for index 
information. That </font></p>

New York City Vital Records Forms</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our 5th Step is to order Social Security Applications. Not 
all of our Ancestors have Social Security Numbers so for those the have them, we 
used the SSDI at Rootsweb.com to get the information we need and used their 
Standard Form letter to make the request. Being expensive, we prefer other 
methods but as in 1 case, that the application it what we needed to jump start 
research that branch of our family. The free page can be found at
<a href="http://ssdi.rootsweb.com/">Social Security Index at Rootsweb.com</a>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our 6th Step includes Census Research.&nbsp; We have used 
1900-1930 Census Information from New York City as well as 1920 Chicopee, Mass 
and other Census Records from outside of New York City. We have used
<em>www.ancestry.com</em> at various 
Libraries as well as the United States National Archives&nbsp; in Washington, DC and 
New York City, New York. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Our 7th Step is to use Ellis Island and or Castle 
Garden..&nbsp;You can also use Steve Morse for Ellis Island and Castle Garden 
Manifest's and information. <a href="EllisIslandRecords.html">Click Here</a> to 
see some of our Family who have come from Ellis Island.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Step 8 includes using the Godfrey Library Web Site (we no 
longer subscribe). From there we can access the Federal Census from Heritage 
Quest, the New York Time, Los Angeles Time and Washington Post Database's.&nbsp; We 
also use the Brooklyn Eagle Database available at the&nbsp;
<a href="http://eagle.brooklynpubliclibrary.org/">Brooklyn Public Library</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Step 9 We recently subscribed to
<em>www.footnote.com&nbsp;</em>(we no longer subscribe) to access United 
States National Archives and New York City Court Naturalization records </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Step 10:&nbsp; Repeat each previous step as often as possible 
and in which ever order makes sense for you, the researcher.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Interview family. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp; Some family will always say they do not know anything. 
Some times that is true. Sometimes that is because they really don't want to 
talk about the past. If that is the case, you might want to try another source. 
When you have determined that they really&nbsp; think they do not know anything, 
start asking questions. Questions like, tell me about your parents, who is so 
and so, where did Grandpa or Grandma grow up?.&nbsp; The stories they will hopefully 
tell you will should include family relationships. Among the things you aim to 
get is family relationships, where your ancestors came from, and with any luck 
dates. You might also want to show your family member a Old Picture and ask them 
who was in that picture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Birth Records, Death Records, Marriage Certificates, 
Immigration Records, Census Records.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you do manage to get some dates, checking the above 
named records will help in getting the names of parents.&nbsp; In checking Census 
Records,&nbsp; you will, at least in the United States, need to know the names of 
parents, where they were living, and if they were living with someone else. I 
know that for us, my great great grandmother was found living with one of her 
daughters in the 1930 United States Census. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Pictures.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you find old family pictures, ask your family who they 
are. </font></p>
